    <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather ingredients</li>
    <li>Heat oil, coook pork</li>
    <li>Add onion/garlic to pan, cook</li>
    <li>Stir in cooked pork, carrots, green onions, cabbage, and cilantro. Season with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Remove from the heat, and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes</li>
    <li>To assemble lumpia: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagonally near one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 ½ inch space at both ends.</li>
    <li>Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends, and roll neatly and tightly to close.</li>
    <li>Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Transfer to a plate and cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Repeat to assemble remaining lumpia.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slide 3 to 4 lumpia into the hot oil, making sure the seams are facing down. Fry, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to fry remaining lumpia.
